# Release Guide

## Automated Release Process

This project is configured with automated CI/CD workflow that builds and publishes releases when new version tags are pushed.

## Release Steps

### 1. Update Version Information

First, update `CHANGELOG.md` to record the changes for this release:

```markdown
## [1.0.1] - 2025-01-15

### Added

- New feature description

### Changed

- Changes description

### Fixed

- Bug fixes description
```

### 2. Commit Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "chore: prepare for release v1.0.1"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Create and Push Tag

```bash
# Create tag
git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Release v1.0.1"

# Push tag to remote repository
git push origin v1.0.1
```

### 4. Automated Build

After pushing the tag, GitHub Actions will automatically:

1. ✅ Build binaries for the following platforms:

   - Linux x86_64
   - Linux ARM64
   - macOS x86_64 (Intel)
   - macOS ARM64 (Apple Silicon)
   - Windows x86_64

2. ✅ Create compressed archives for each binary:

   - Linux/macOS: `.tar.gz` format
   - Windows: `.zip` format

3. ✅ Generate SHA256 checksums file (`checksums.txt`)

4. ✅ Automatically create GitHub Release

5. ✅ Upload all binaries to the Release

### 5. Verify Release

Visit the GitHub Releases page to verify:

```
https://github.com/talkincode/sshmcp/releases
```

Check:

- ✅ Release has been created
- ✅ All 5 platform binaries have been uploaded
- ✅ checksums.txt file exists
- ✅ Release notes are complete

## Version Numbering

Follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) specification:

- **MAJOR version**: incompatible API changes
- **MINOR version**: backwards-compatible functionality additions
- **PATCH version**: backwards-compatible bug fixes

Examples:

Examples:

- `v1.0.0` - Initial stable release
- `v1.1.0` - Add new features
- `v1.1.1` - Bug fixes
- `v2.0.0` - Breaking changes, not backwards compatible

## Pre-release Versions

To publish a test version:

```bash
# Beta version
git tag -a v1.1.0-beta.1 -m "Release v1.1.0-beta.1"
git push origin v1.1.0-beta.1

# Release Candidate version
git tag -a v1.1.0-rc.1 -m "Release v1.1.0-rc.1"
git push origin v1.1.0-rc.1
```

Pre-release versions will be marked as "Pre-release" in GitHub Release.

## Delete Incorrect Tags

If you pushed an incorrect tag:

```bash
# Delete local tag
git tag -d v1.0.1

# Delete remote tag
git push origin :refs/tags/v1.0.1
```

## Manual Build (Development Testing)

To test the build locally:

```bash
# Build all platforms
make build-all

# View build results
ls -lh bin/
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failure

1. Check GitHub Actions logs
2. Verify `go.mod` dependencies are correct
3. Ensure all tests pass: `make test`

### Release Not Created

1. Check if tag format matches `v*.*.*`
2. Verify GitHub Actions permissions
3. Check if `GITHUB_TOKEN` is valid

### File Upload Failure

1. Check file size limits
2. Verify network connection
3. Review detailed error messages in Actions logs

## CI/CD Workflows

### Release Workflow (.github/workflows/release.yml)

Trigger: Push tags matching `v*.*.*` format

Tasks:

1. Checkout code

### CI Workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml)

Trigger: Push to main/develop branches or Pull Requests

Tasks:

1. Run tests on multiple operating systems
2. Generate code coverage reports
3. Run code checks (golangci-lint)
4. Run security scans (gosec)
