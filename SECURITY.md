  - Release a security patch
  - Credit you in the release notes (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
  - Publish a security advisory with details

### Security Update Process

1. **Triage**: We evaluate the severity and impact of the reported vulnerability
2. **Fix Development**: We develop and test a fix
3. **Release**: We release a patched version
4. **Notification**: We notify users through:
   - GitHub Security Advisories
   - Release notes
   - CHANGELOG updates

## Security Best Practices

When using SSHMCP, we recommend:

- **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version with security patches
- **Secure Credentials**: Use the built-in password management feature to store SSH credentials securely
- **SSH Keys**: Prefer SSH key authentication over password authentication when possible
- **Review Commands**: Always review commands before execution, especially with the `--force` flag
- **Limit Permissions**: Run SSHMCP with minimum required privileges
- **Network Security**: Use SSHMCP only on trusted networks when handling sensitive credentials

## Known Security Considerations

### Command Validation

SSHMCP includes built-in validation to prevent dangerous commands (e.g., `rm -rf /`, `:(){ :|:& };:`). However:

- The `--force` flag bypasses these checks
- Always review commands before using `--force`
- Be cautious when executing scripts from untrusted sources

### Credential Storage

- Passwords are stored in the system keyring (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, Linux Secret Service)
- SSH private keys should have appropriate file permissions (600)
- Never commit credentials to version control

## Contact

For security-related questions or concerns that are not vulnerabilities, please open a regular issue on GitHub or contact the maintainers directly.

**Note**: Please do not publicly disclose security vulnerabilities until we have had a chance to address them.
